## ## Why a "Helper"? (Chromium Browser vs. Firefox)

Due to **Chromium Browser's security policies**, extensions are not allowed to change core security settings like your DNS provider automatically. This is a safety feature to protect you from malicious extensions.

Therefore, this extension acts as a **"helper"**. It makes the manual process incredibly simple by automating two key steps:
1.  It opens the correct settings page for you.
2.  It copies the required Cloudflare URL to your clipboard.

This turns a confusing task into a simple one-click-and-paste action. The Firefox version of this add-on can automate the process completely due to different extension APIs.
